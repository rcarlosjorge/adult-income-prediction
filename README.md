# Machine Learning Project - Adult Income

This project is an example of how to use decision tree and random forest techniques to predict adult income based on a dataset called adults.csv.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to have installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-Learn, Numpy, and Pandas libraries

## Dataset

The adults.csv dataset contains information about individuals over 16 years old, including their age, education, marital status, occupation, and other attributes. The goal is to predict whether a person earns more or less than $50,000 per year based on these attributes.

The dataset can be found in the data folder of the project.

## Decision Tree and Random Forest

To solve this binary classification problem, two machine learning techniques have been used: decision tree and random forest.

Decision trees are supervised learning models used for classification and regression. In this project, a decision tree has been used to predict adult income.

Random forest is a machine learning method used for classification, regression, and other tasks. In this project, a random forest has been used to predict adult income.

## How to Run the Project

Download the repository from GitHub and extract the files to a local folder.
Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
Run the command "jupyter notebook" to start Jupyter Notebook.
Open the file "adult_income_prediction.ipynb".
Run the notebook cells to load the data, train and evaluate the models.
Results

The decision tree and random forest models have been trained and evaluated with an accuracy of approximately 85% in predicting adult income.

## Conclusions

This project demonstrates how to use decision tree and random forest techniques to predict adult income based on attribute data. The trained models were able to accurately predict income for individuals with an accuracy of around 85%.
